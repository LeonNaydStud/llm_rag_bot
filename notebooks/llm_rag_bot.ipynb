         "What is Python?",
         "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows. To find out more, start with The Python Tutorial(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index).

         "The explicit use of 'self' (borrowed from Modula-3) provides several key benefits. First, it makes code more readable and explicit: seeing `self.x` or `self.meth()` immediately signals that an instance attribute or method is being used, distinguishing it from a local variable—a crucial clarity in a language without variable declarations. Second, it provides a simple, uniform syntax for explicitly calling a method from a specific class, such as a base class method (e.g., `BaseClass.methodname(self, args)`), which is especially useful in inheritance scenarios like `__init__` overrides. This avoids the need for special operators like C++'s `::`.",

Without a declaration mechanism like in C++, there would be no syntactic way to indicate that an assignment (`var = value`) is meant to modify an instance variable rather than create a local variable. Using `self.var = value` provides this distinction unambiguously. Similarly, accessing `self.var` tells the interpreter to look in the instance's namespace, avoiding unnecessary searches of the local namespace and making variable resolution more efficient and predictable.

         "As Guido said: (a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than postfix – prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x*a + x*b to the clumsiness of doing the same thing using a raw OO notation. (b) When I read code that says len(x) I know that it is asking for the length of something. This tells me two things: the result is an integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary, when I read x.len(), I have to already know that x is some kind of container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that has a standard len(). Witness the confusion we occasionally have when a class that is not implementing a mapping has a get() or keys() method, or something that isn’t a file has a write() method. —https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html",

If the key was frequently missing, a more performant approach was to use an explicit check with `if key in mydict:` before access.

         "Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. It supports multiple programming paradigms beyond object-oriented programming, such as procedural and functional programming. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants including Linux and macOS, and on Windows. To find out more, start with The Python Tutorial(https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html#tutorial-index).

First, it makes code more readable and explicit: seeing `self.x` or `self.meth()` immediately signals that an instance attribute or method is being used, distinguishing it from a local variable—a crucial clarity in a language without variable declarations. Second, it provides a simple, uniform syntax for explicitly calling a method from a specific class, such as a base class method (e.g., `BaseClass.methodname(self, args)`), which is especially useful in inheritance scenarios like `__init__` overrides.

Without a declaration mechanism like in C++, there would be no syntactic way to indicate that an assignment (`var = value`) is meant to modify an instance variable rather than create a local variable. Using `self.var = value` provides this distinction unambiguously. Similarly, accessing `self.var` tells the interpreter to look in the instance's namespace, avoiding unnecessary searches of the local namespace and making variable resolution more efficient and predictable.

         "Why does Python use methods for some functionality (e.g. list.index()) but functions for other (e.g. len(list))?",
         "As Guido said: (a) For some operations, prefix notation just reads better than postfix – prefix (and infix!) operations have a long tradition in mathematics which likes notations where the visuals help the mathematician thinking about a problem. Compare the easy with which we rewrite a formula like x*(a+b) into x*a + x*b to the clumsiness of doing the same thing using a raw OO notation. (b) When I read code that says len(x) I know that it is asking for the length of something. This tells me two things: the result is an integer, and the argument is some kind of container. To the contrary, when I read x.len(), I have to already know that x is some kind of container implementing an interface or inheriting from a class that has a standard len(). Witness the confusion we occasionally have when a class that is not implementing a mapping has a get() or keys() method, or something that isn’t a file has a write() method. —https://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-3000/2006-November/004643.html",

         "join() is a string method because its primary action is performed by the separator string, not the sequence. Conceptually, you are instructing the separator string (e.g., \", \") to iterate over a sequence of strings and insert itself between each element. This design emphasizes that the separator is the active agent in the operation. While some argue it would feel more natural as a sequence method (e.g., list.join(\", \")), Python's approach treats the separator as the subject executing the join, mirroring how split() is a string method where the string splits itself around a separator.",

Just as split() is a string method because a string splits itself, join() is a string method because the separator string actively combines other strings. This consistency extends to other types like bytes and bytearray, which have their own join methods. This design allows any object that behaves like a sequence of strings (including custom classes) to be joined, maintaining flexibility and adhering to the principle that methods should be attached to the object most responsible for the action.",

         "In Python, a try/except block is extremely efficient when no exception is raised. However, the act of actually catching an exception is computationally expensive. Therefore, a common performance idiom in earlier versions of Python was to use try/except only when the expected condition (e.g., a key being in a dictionary) was the overwhelmingly common case. If the key was frequently missing, a more performant approach was to use an explicit check with `if key in mydict:` before access. For dictionary key handling, `dict.setdefault()` or (in modern Python) `dict.get()` can also be suitable alternatives, provided any fallback value computation is inexpensive.",

Prior to this, Python programmers used alternatives like a sequence of `if... elif... elif... else` statements. For a large number of cases, a common and efficient pattern is to use a dictionary that maps values to corresponding functions or methods, which are then called directly. When dealing with object methods, `getattr()` can be used to dynamically retrieve and call a method based on a constructed name, though a prefix (e.g., 'visit_') is recommended for security when handling untrusted input.",

Functions are already first class objects in Python, and can be declared in a local scope. Therefore the only advantage of using a lambda instead of a locally defined function is that you don’t need to invent a name for the function – but that’s just a local variable to which the function object (which is exactly the same type of object that a lambda expression yields) is assigned!",

To handle reference cycles (where objects reference each other but are otherwise inaccessible), CPython supplements this with a cyclic garbage collector that periodically detects and collects such cycles. A key limitation of relying solely on this automatic scheme is that it can lead to portability issues: code depending on CPython's immediate cleanup (e.g., file descriptors being closed when a variable is reassigned) may fail in other Python implementations (like Jython or PyPy) that use different garbage collection strategies.",
